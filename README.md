This tool is used to commit the bugs system easily.
It is based on "seleium" tool ,the website is following:
http://www.seleniumhq.org/download/

At first, we entered into the website,

secondly, the tool could help us to fetch some useful information ,and save it into excel file.We could edit the file.

Last but not least,we could commit the necessary information to the url which we fetch from the website.
